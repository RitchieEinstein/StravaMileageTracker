# StravaMileageTracker


# Installation:

1. Create a MySQL database along with a user and password. (We suggest you to give just the INSERT, SELECT AND UPDATE privileges for the user).

2. Open the dbconnect.php file and update the database related fields in their appropriate variables.

3. We believe that by this stage, you might have registered your application with STRAVA developers page. After successful registration you'll be provided with a ClientID and ClientSecret.
